# Artificial Intelligence Usage Policy  
*(Applicable to Google Summer of Code Contributors and Applicants)*

## 1. Purpose
This policy defines the acceptable use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools within our organization during all phases of participation in Google Summer of Code (GSoC), including pre-application contributions, proposal writing, development, and reporting.

Our goal is to allow AI as a **productivity and learning accelerator**, while ensuring that all accepted contributors demonstrate **genuine understanding, authorship, and responsibility** for their work.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to:
- GSoC proposals
- Pre-proposal contributions (issues, discussions, pull requests)
- Accepted project work (code, documentation, design)
- Weekly reports and final evaluations
- Any communication or artifact submitted to the organization

---

## 3. Permitted Use of AI Tools
Contributors **may use AI tools** for:
- Brainstorming and refining ideas
- Improving clarity, grammar, or structure of text
- Learning unfamiliar concepts or APIs
- Debugging assistance
- Code explanation or refactoring suggestions

AI is considered an **assistant**, not an author.

---

## 4. Mandatory Disclosure
AI usage **must be explicitly disclosed** in all relevant contexts, including but not limited to:
- GSoC proposals
- Pull requests and commit messages
- Reports and documentation

At minimum, contributors must state **that AI was used**.
Whenever possible, contributors should also explain **how the AI was used** (e.g., for debugging, rewriting, brainstorming).

Failure to disclose AI usage is considered a **policy violation**.

---

## 5. Authorship & Understanding Requirements
All submitted work must:
- Be fully understood by the contributor
- Be explainable on request by mentors or reviewers
- Reflect active human decision-making

The following are **not acceptable**:
- Fully AI-generated proposals
- Code written by AI that the contributor cannot explain
- Submissions copied from AI outputs without review or comprehension

AI must **not** be used as a replacement for thinking, design decisions, or learning.

---

## 6. Contribution Quality Standards
When contributing code (including pre-proposal PRs):
- Large, untested, or unexplained submissions (e.g., thousands of lines of code) will not be accepted
- Contributors are expected to submit **small, atomic, reviewable changes** whenever possible
- Code must be tested, justified, and aligned with project goals

AI-assisted code does not exempt contributors from these standards.

---

## 7. Review, Clarification, and Enforcement
If a mentor or reviewer believes that:
- AI has been used improperly, or
- The contributor does not understand their own submission,

A **clarification round** will be initiated, giving the contributor an opportunity to:
- Explain their work
- Revise the submission
- Correct disclosure issues

Repeated misuse, inability to demonstrate understanding, or intentional deception may result in:
- Proposal rejection
- Pull request rejection
- Removal from consideration or the program, at mentor discretion

---

## 8. Mentor Oversight
Mentors are expected to:
- Actively assess contributor understanding
- Ask clarification questions when AI usage is suspected
- Ensure AI is being used as a productivity aid, not a dependency

Mentor judgment is final in matters related to AI usage compliance.

---

## 9. Final Note
Using AI tools responsibly is encouraged.
Using AI to avoid learning, understanding, or accountability is not.
